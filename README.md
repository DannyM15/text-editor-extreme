## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation for this week's assignment is to learn more about Progressive Web Applications.  The ability to have my future apps be able to be downloaded is vital to the success of my future applications so I'd like to learn as much as possible.  The major issue I ran into was having the IndexedDB working correctly with my application.  After fixing a few typos and with some assistance debugging I was able to intall the application on my desktop and store the data to my local device.
